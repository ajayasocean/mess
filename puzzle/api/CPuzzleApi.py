"""
The coding assignment, that I have for you is:
Create a FAST API based application,
which exposes an endpoint where you can fill in the values for {head_count} & {leg_count}
to formulate the common classic ancient Chinese puzzle:
We count {head_count} heads and {leg_count} legs among the chickens and rabbits in a farm.
How many rabbits and how many chickens do we have? then returns the answer as a JSON.
